[WORK IN PROGRESS] nRF24L01 driver library for node.js

See also [node-rf24](https://github.com/natevw/node-rf24) albeit also unfinished. Where that was intended as a wrapper around the RasPi port of the C++ [RF24 library](https://github.com/stanleyseow/RF24), this will be implemented in pure JavaScript on top of native [SPI bindings](https://github.com/natevw/pi-spi).
